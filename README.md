In this project I am creating a simple Weather app. The purpose of this project is to practice the using a real API to fetch data into a simple web app.

This App uses an API to fetch the current weather from openweatherapp.org and a different api to fetch random gifs from giphy.com.

This is a Javascript project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app#null)
